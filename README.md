X-ARES: eXtensive Audio Representation and Evaluation Suite

## Introduction

X-ARES is a toolkit for training, evaluating, and exporting audio encoders for various audio tasks. It is heavily inspired by the [HEAR benchmark](https://hearbenchmark.com/), but offers faster performance, greater flexibility, and enhanced extensibility.

## Roadmap
